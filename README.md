# Anki-Cardgen: Vocabulary Flashcards Generator for Anki

Easily create vocabulary flashcards for Anki using a large language model (LLM) and optional text-to-speech (TTS) audio. This tool automatically manages deck creation and can push cards directly to your Anki deck, helping you focus on studying instead of repetitive card creation.

For now it only works for German because of strict Anki format-setup. Next update will allow flexibility

## Features

- Generate flashcards from a list of words or idioms  
- Uses customizable prompts to get precise flashcard content
- Optionally generate audio examples via TTS for better pronunciation practice
- Automatically create Anki decks and deck format if they donâ€™t exist  
- Push generated cards directly to Anki via AnkiConnect  
- Outputs results as CSV for manual review or import manually  

## Requirements

- Anki with [AnkiConnect](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/2055492159) installed and running  
- Establishing a local API (i.e. via LMStudio easily)
